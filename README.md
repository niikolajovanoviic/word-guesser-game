# Word Guesser Game

**Word Guesser Game** is a console-based application built in **C#**. The game is designed to challenge players to guess a randomly selected word by uncovering it one letter at a time. Words are dynamically fetched from an external API, ensuring a fresh experience with every playthrough.

---

## **Features**
- Fetches a list of words from an online API dynamically.
- Randomly selects a secret word from the fetched list.
- Engaging gameplay where the player guesses the word letter by letter.
- Feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Tracks player's progress by displaying uncovered letters and the number of attempts left.

---

## **How It Works**
1. The application retrieves a list of words from an API at runtime.
2. A word is selected randomly from the list.
3. The player is prompted to guess letters one by one:
   - Correct guesses reveal the position of the letter in the word.
   - Incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts.
4. The game ends when:
   - The player successfully guesses the entire word.
   - The player runs out of attempts.

## **Prerequisites**
- **.NET Core SDK** installed on your machine.
- Internet connection (required for fetching words from the API).
